-ROS 2 Core Concepts
Topics, Services, Actions → how robots talk.

Launch files, packages, nodes → project structure.

Practical: publish angles to servos, read feedback, control joints.

- Robot Description (URDF/XACRO)
Model your arm in URDF (each link + joint).

Use RViz2 to visualize your robot.

Practical: define base, shoulder, elbow, wrist, gripper → 6 revolute joints.

3. Transforms (TF2)

Learn coordinate frames in robotics.

How each joint relates in 3D space.

Practical: move a joint → see the chain of transformations in RViz.

4. Kinematics

Forward kinematics → given joint angles, find end-effector position.

Inverse kinematics (IK) → given a target position, calculate joint angles.

Practical: use MoveIt 2 to automatically compute IK and plan paths.


5. Motion Planning (MoveIt 2)

Learn trajectory generation.

Avoid collisions in workspace.


6. Simulation (Gazebo / Ignition)

Test your arm virtually before running real hardware.

Run the same ROS 2 nodes in sim and on hardware.

Practical: practice grasping tasks, automate trajectories.

7. Control Framework (ros2_control)

Learn how to interface hardware with ROS 2.

ESP32 or Arduino → servo driver.

Practical: send trajectories from MoveIt 2 → executed by your servos.

8. Higher-Level Robotics

Path planning (OMPL in MoveIt).

Grasp planning (basic grasp libraries).

Sensor integration (camera, force sensor for feedback).

Practical: detect object with camera → move arm → grasp.

9. Real-World Robotics Skills

Hardware–software integration (ESP32 + micro-ROS).

Robotics middleware (DDS in ROS 2).

Simulation-to-real transfer (what you simulate → robot does in real life).

These are industry skills used in automation, research, AI + robotics.
